## Introduction

I really wanted a way to control my music, whilst being able to see the track cover art, without costing a fortune, by using this £16 [Guition ESP32-S3-4848S040](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3sIhvBv) screen and home assistant.

It is built with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) and [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/). It connects to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to control and collect the track data, and has been tested with Google and Sonos speakers.

## Features

### Album Art Display

Full-screen 480x480 album art fetched directly from your Home Assistant instance. When a new track starts, the current artwork dims to 40% opacity while the new image downloads, giving instant visual feedback that a change is happening. Once loaded, the new art fades back to full brightness. 

### Now Playing Info

Displays the song title, artist name, elapsed and remaining time, and a progress bar at the bottom of the screen. The progress bar updates every second with smooth interpolation between Home Assistant position updates. 

### Auto-Hide Track Info

When a new track starts, the overlay (title, artist, time, play/pause button) automatically appears. There are controls in the device page inside Home Assistant. Setting the timer to 0 will keep the overlay permanently visible. See [Configurable Settings](#configurable-settings) for details.

### Touch Controls

- **Play / Pause** -- corner button in the bottom-right corner toggles playback.
- **Next / Previous track** -- swipe the screen to change tracks. 
- **Volume** -- swipe down to open the settings panel, which shows an interactive arc dial. Drag the arc knob to set volume, or use the **+** and **-** buttons for fine 1% adjustments. The current volume percentage is displayed in the centre of the dial. Swipe up to close.
- Hide / ShowUI -- Tap anywhere when the track is playing to hide the UI information.
- **Room Controls** -- swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access lighting and scene controls. *(Enhanced feature - see [Swipe-Up Controls](#swipe-up-controls) below)*

### Screensaver

When playback is paused, the device has a two-stage screensaver.

1. After a configurable period of inactivity, the screen dims to a day or night brightness level.
2. After a further timeout, the screen turns off completely.

Settings are fully configurable from Home Assistant (see [Configurable Settings](#configurable-settings) below).

## Install Guide

The easiest way to get started -- no ESPHome knowledge required.

### What You Need

- A **Guition ESP32-S3-4848S040** panel (see [Where to Buy](#where-to-buy))
- A **USB-C cable**
- **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** on desktop
- **Home Assistant** with a media player entity already configured

### Step 1: Flash the Firmware

1. Connect the Guition panel to your computer with a USB-C cable.
2. Visit the Web Installer and click **Install**.

     <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_Web_Installer-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=esphome&logoColor=white" alt="Open Web Installer" />
   </a>

3. Select the serial port for your device and wait for the flash to complete.

> **Tip:** If the device is not detected, you may need to install the [CH340 USB driver](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_EXE.html) for your operating system.

### Step 2: Connect to WiFi

After flashing, the device will create a WiFi hotspot:

1. Connect to the hotspot from your phone or computer.
2. A captive portal will open -- enter your home WiFi network name and password.
3. The device will restart and connect to your network.

### Step 3: Adopt in Home Assistant

Once the device connects to your WiFi:

1. Home Assistant should automatically discover it. Check **Settings > Devices & Services** for a new ESPHome notification.
2. Click **Configure** and follow the prompts to adopt the device.
3. The device and its entities will appear in Home Assistant.

### Step 4: Select Your Media Player

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > ESPHome** and click on your device.
2. Under **Configuration**, find the **Media Player** text field.
3. Enter the entity ID of the media player you want to control (e.g., `media_player.living_room`).

### Step 5: Enable Device Controls

To allow the screen to control your media player (play, pause, skip, volume), you need to grant the device permission in Home Assistant.

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations** and click on **ESPHome** (not the blue device count link).

![ESPHome Integration](images/ha-esphome-list.png)

2. Find your device and click the **cog icon** to open its settings.

![Device Settings Cog](images/ha-esphome-device.png)

3. Enable **"Allow the device to perform Home Assistant actions"** and click **Submit**.

### Automatic Updates

The device automatically checks for firmware updates every 6 hours. When an update is available, a **Firmware Update** entity appears in Home Assistant. You can trigger the update from there or let it notify you.

## Swipe-Up Controls

This enhanced version of the ESPHome Media Player includes swipe-up controls that allow you to access lighting and scene controls directly from the bottom of the screen.

### Features

* **Swipe Detection Area** - A designated area at the bottom of the screen that detects when you swipe up
* **Animated Control Panel** - A panel that smoothly slides up to reveal your room controls
* **Lighting Controls** - Buttons to toggle your lights on/off
* **Scene Activation** - Buttons to activate predefined Home Assistant scenes
* **Customizable Interface** - Easily modify the buttons to match your specific Home Assistant entities

### How It Works

1. When you swipe up from the bottom of the screen, a control panel slides up from the bottom
2. The panel contains buttons for your lights and scenes
3. Tap any button to control your Home Assistant entities
4. Swipe down or tap the X button to dismiss the panel

### Customization

To customize the swipe-up controls for your specific setup:

1. Edit `addon/swipe-controls/controls.yaml` to modify the buttons and their actions
2. Update button labels to match your light and scene names
3. Connect buttons to your actual Home Assistant entities using the `homeassistant.service` action
4. Adjust colors and positioning to match your preferences

See `addon/swipe-controls/ha_integration_example.yaml` for examples of connecting buttons to Home Assistant entities.

### Example Integration

To connect a button to a Home Assistant light entity:

```yaml
event_handlers:
  on_click:
    - homeassistant.service:
        service: light.toggle
        data:
          entity_id: light.your_light_entity
```

## Configurable Settings

### Media Player Selection (configurable at runtime)

The media player entity is configured from the Home Assistant device settings page — no YAML editing or reflashing required. After first boot, the display shows **"Set media player in device settings"** until you configure it:

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > ESPHome** and click on your device.
2. Under **Configuration**, find the **Media Player** text field.
3. Enter the entity ID of the media player you want to control (e.g., `media_player.living_room`).

The device will immediately start tracking the selected media player. The selection persists across reboots. You can change it at any time without reflashing.
